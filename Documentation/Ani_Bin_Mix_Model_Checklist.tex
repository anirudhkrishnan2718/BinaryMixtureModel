	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Look at each cell outline andd size visually to sort good and bad cells.
		\item \textit{Mathematical method to do this sorting?} : Plot heatmap of cell fluorescence as a function of repeated stimulus trial along with PSTH. 
		\item Sort and label cells by mutual information ranking and separately by average activity ranking
		\item Perform spike sorting and plot similar heatmap as above for all cells
		\item Binarize spike trains to end up with logical array of size N cells by T timebins.
		\item \textit{Measures of Stationarity} : Look at what fraction of all timebins in each stimulus block are the silent state. Plot this fraction vs block number
		\item Plot average activity in each block averaged across all cells
